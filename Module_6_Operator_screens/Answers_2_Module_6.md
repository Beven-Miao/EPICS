#Module 6: Operator screens

---

##4. Questions
1. Are there any guidelines that must be followed for GUI design?
> To make the screens user friendly guidelines are to be followed. At Cosylab we usually follow the [Australian synchrotron guidelines](https://internal.cosylab.com/wiki/pub/Accelerator/ModuleEpicsEDM/ASP-ICS-1009_GUI_Style_Guide_Rev1.pdf). Note: these guidelines are outdated, they were used for EDM. They will be replaced with **ESS GUI Design Guidelines** when they are ready.

2. How can I change display defaults?
>  You can change display by selectting ``Open Perspective`` in ``Window`` menu. For example, you can change the perspective to OPI Editor by ``Window -> Open Perspective -> Other ... -> OPI Editor``

3. How to snap objects to grid?
> This function can be enabled either from **Toggle Snap to Geometry** button on toolbar or from display **properties**.

4. How to align objects?
> Multiple selected widgets can be arranged in different ways with **arranging buttons** on **toolbar**. You can use these buttons to align objects.

5. How to open other screens?
> By default, Open OPI action will replace the current OPI with the new OPI. But **Ctrl-Cliking** a widget with Open OPI action attached will open the OPI in a new Tab. Or in a new window by **Shift-Cliking**.

6. How to execute shell commands?
> 1. Select **Scripts** property in property sheet view.
> 2. In **Attach Scripts** Dialog, you can add more than one script.
> 3. **Save** and **run** the OPI to see the result.
